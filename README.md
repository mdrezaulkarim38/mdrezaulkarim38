- 👋 Hi, I’m @mdrezaulkarim38, but you can call me RKSavant!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming - I love it so much that I can't imagine feeling good without coding!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data structures and algorithms to strengthen my problem-solving skills.
- 💼 I’m currently working on ASP.NET Core 8 MVC and API development, but I also enjoy working with the MERN stack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on API development projects and exploring design patterns.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at mdrezaulkarim31295@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have projects in both the MERN stack and ASP.NET Core, and I'm excited about the challenge of working with both JavaScript and .NET simultaneously!
